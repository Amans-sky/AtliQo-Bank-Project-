## Overview
Phase 2 builds on the initial analysis by implementing **A/B testing strategies** to target untapped markets, particularly focusing on the **18â€“25 age group**.

## Objectives
- Perform **A/B testing trial** to measure the impact of the new credit card offering.
- Focus on young demographics with low credit history and growing purchasing potential.
- Analyze effect size, power, and statistical significance for campaign success.

## Key Insights
- **25% of customers** belong to the 18â€“25 age group.
- Average income: **< â‚¹50,000 annually**.
- Low existing credit card usage and transaction amounts.
- Top spending categories: **Electronics, Fashion & Apparel, Beauty & Personal Care**.

## Methodology
1. Pre-Campaign Analysis â€“ Calculate required sample size using effect size and statistical power.
2. A/B Testing â€“ Split into control and test groups.
3. Campaign Launch â€“ Targeted marketing for young professionals and students.
4. Post-Campaign Evaluation â€“ Measure adoption rate, spending behavior, and profitability.

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, statsmodels)
- Statistical methods for sample size determination and hypothesis testing.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scipy statsmodels
jupyter notebook phase_2_atliqo_bank.ipynb
```

## Future Enhancements
- Expand A/B testing to **other demographic segments (25â€“35, 35â€“50)**.
- Develop a **predictive model for long-term credit card retention**.
- Automate **campaign optimization using reinforcement learning**.

## Outcome
Phase 2 enables data-driven decision-making by conducting controlled experiments before a full-scale launch, minimizing risks and optimizing marketing costs.
